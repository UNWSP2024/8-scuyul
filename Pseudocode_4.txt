Create an empty dictionary called course_list

Print "Enter course information:"

Loop forever:
    Ask "Enter course ID (or 'done' to finish): "
    Get course_id from user

    If course_id is "done":
        Exit the loop

    Ask "Enter course name: "
    Get course_name from user

    Store course_id and course_name in course_list

Ask "Enter subject to search for: "
Get search_subject from user

Print "Courses with subject" and search_subject

Set found_count to 0

For each course_id and course_name in course_list:
    Split course_id by spaces and take the first part as subject

    If subject matches search_subject:
        Print course_id + ": " + course_name
        Add 1 to found_count

If found_count is 0:
    Print "No courses found with subject" and search_subject
